\begin{abstract}
Cloud Service Providers allocate machine instances non-contiguously to achieve higher utilization of their resources. This allocation method makes it difficult to control the network latency between instances. Latency is a key bottleneck for many computational workloads, especially those found in scientific and big data tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting latency-optimal clusters within a non-contiguously allocated machine instance environment. We provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of our method in the context of optimizing a large computing cluster on Amazon Web Services.
